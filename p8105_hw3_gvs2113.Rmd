## Problem 1 
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

```

At first glance, the `instacart` data set consists of `r ncol(instacart)` columns and `r nrow(instacart)` observations. The information provided in this data set reveals characteristics of the buyer, their buying habits, the food order and the food products included. There is data included for a total of `r n_distinct(pull(instacart, order_id))` orders placed using the Instacart app. 

## Problem 2 
```{r}
